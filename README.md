## Running the project

### Build the project and Start the server

As requested in the instructions, I have modified npm start to jointly run
```bash
npm run build && next start
```
Therefore, to create a production build and start the server, the following command can be used:
```bash
npm start
```
Please note: npm start relies on the build created by npm run build. Make sure to complete the build step before attempting to start the server.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the project in your browser.

### Development Mode

For development purposes, you can run the development server which includes hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This command starts the development server and opens the project in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the page.
